# Hellevator

### An upcoming game designed, developed and produced by Scope It Down Studios.

Loosely based on themes from Dante's Inferno and Paradise Lost, Hellevator follows the journey of the Grim Reaper's apprentice, Lil' Death, as he fights his way out of the Nine Levels of Hell. Having fallen down to the lowest level, Lil' Death enlists the help of Lucifer, who also wishes to be freed.
Using their combined strength, the player must face the denizen of each level in this fast-paced, dark-fantasy boss rush game.
